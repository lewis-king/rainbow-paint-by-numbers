# Rainbow Paint by Numbers

A wholesome paint-by-numbers app made with love, by a dad and daughter, for that daughter.

## Why This Exists

Like many parents, I got tired of watching my daughter navigate through ad-riddled, in-app-purchase-laden colouring apps that seemed more interested in monetisation than providing a good experience. So we decided to make our own.

This app is tailored specifically to her taste, featuring cute designs that come to life when you complete a painting! The reward for finishing isn't a popup asking for money — it's watching your artwork animate into something magical.

## Asset Generation

All the artwork in this app is generated using AI, then post-processed into paintable segments.

### Text-to-Image: Flux2 Dev

We use [Flux2 Dev](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux2) to generate the base artwork.

**Positive Prompt:**
```
(masterpiece), flat vector art, children's coloring book style, cute [SUBJECT], simple shapes, thick bold outlines, cel shaded, vibrant solid colors, white background, minimalist, high contrast, 2d game asset, no dithering
```

**Negative Prompt:**
```
shading, gradients, noise, texture, realistic, photography, 3d, rendering, complex details, fuzzy, sketch, watermark, text, greyscale
```

This produces clean, bold, child-friendly artwork with distinct color regions perfect for a paint-by-numbers game.

### Image-to-Video: Wan2.2

When a painting is completed, we play an animation generated by [Wan2.2](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.2) that brings the static artwork to life. This gives kids that satisfying "wow" moment as their finished work starts moving!

### Post-Processing: Creating Paintable Segments

The generated images go through a post-processing pipeline to become usable game assets:

1. **Color Quantization** — Reduce the image to a limited palette of distinct, solid colors
2. **Boundary Detection** — Identify edges between color regions using contour detection
3. **Segment Extraction** — Convert each color region into a discrete, fillable polygon
4. **Outline Generation** — Create the thick black outlines that define each segment
5. **Metadata Export** — Map each segment to its target color for gameplay validation

The result is a set of clearly defined regions that players can tap to fill, with the app tracking progress toward the original colored design.
